    The Vehicle Routing Problems are the most studied in the field of combinatorial optimization. The Vehicle Routing Problems emerge naturally as a central problem in transportation, distribution and logistics, being high the number of actual cases that can be outlined with a vehicle routing problem optimization, including, among others, the distribution of goods or services to customers, express-delivery of orders, transportation of students, transportation for the elderly and chronically ill, garbage collection, etc.. Given the importance of this subject, this project seeks to build a computing platform able to find efficient solutions for the transport, distribution and logistics problems, as described above, which minimizes the distance traveled by the vehicles.
